I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate in Astrophysics and Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I am mostly interested in Galaxy Dynamics, Galaxy Nuclei, and SMBH binaries.  My previous work has studied stellar systems around a host SMBH in the presence of a binary SMBH, specifcally looking at the physics of the inspiral and how it affects the host disk. In the future I would be eager to explore larger scale systems with more complexity (i.e. considering Magnetohydrodynamical effects, GR effects, etc.).
