I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate in Astrophysics and Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I am mostly interested in Galaxy Dynamics, Galaxy Nuclei, and Cosmology.  My previous work has studied stellar systems around a host SMBH in the presence of a binary SMBH. This has led to my inerests in Galaxy Evolution and Cosmology and I am eager to explore larger scale systems.
