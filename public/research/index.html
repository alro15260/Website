    <p>I am broadly interested in N-body simulations and dynamics of complex systems.  So far I have studied systems on only parsec scales but I am eager to extend my study to larger galactic and cosmological systems in the future.</p>
<h2 id="eccentric-nuclear-disks-and-mergers">Eccentric Nuclear Disks and Mergers</h2>
<p>Galactic Nuclei provide an interesting laboratory for dynamicists.  Within Galactic Nuclei, the host SMBH will have a disk of stars in its orbit.  Previous work has found that some of these SMBH systems will produce disks of stars on apsidally-aligned eccentric oribts, or an eccentric nuclear disk (END).</p>
<p>Previous studies of the END only considered varying parameters in its isolation.  However, a second SMBH can also be present since ENDs can form in gas-rich galaxy mergers.  My work was the first to study the evolution of the END in the presence of a perturbing SMBH.</p>
<p>I found that in idealized END-Merger systems, the disk stars could be as much as four times more aligned than in the isolated case.  This produced other dynamically interesting results as well, summarized in the paper above.</p>
<h2 id="the-restricted-3-body-problem">The Restricted 3-body Problem</h2>
<p>Within the END-Merger system, the disk particle can be treated as massless in compararision to a massive perturbing SMBH around the primary SMBH.  This motivates the restricted 3-body problem.  In my attempts at analytic solutions, I have approached the problem with the unusal complications of a a massive non-planar perturbing body while the disk particle can have arbitary eccentricity.</p>
